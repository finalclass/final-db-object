# FinalDBObject

FinalDBObject is realtime database system. The concept is to have one big object that synchronizes with all the clients in real time using web socket.

## Under construction

The work is still under construction!!! You can experiment with this software but you shouldn't use it in production right now.

But you can even now check out the examples. All of them works.

## TODO

- Access control
- Visual admin
- Other db adapters.
